DOMinatorJS
========
If you ever get tired of declaring DOM elements like that:
```javascript
var formNode, submitButtonNode, nameInputNode, emailInputNode;
window.onload = function(){
    formNode = document.getElementById('form');
    submitButtonNode = document.getElementById('submit');
    nameInputNode = document.getElementById('name');
    emailInputNode = document.getElementById('email');
    console.log(formNode, submitButtonNode, nameInputNode, emailInputNode);
}
```
You've come to the right place!
# introducing: DOMinator
DOMinator gives you easy and worry-less access to DOM elements, without having to declare each and every one of them individually.

# example
The code above is replaced by this:

```javascript
var dominator = Dominator.getInstance();
dominator.initIds('form', 'submit', 'name', 'email');
dominator.onReady(function (dom) {
    console.log(dom.form, dom.submit, dom.name, dom.email);
});
```

# how to use

Include either ```dominator.js``` or ```dominator.min.js``` in your web page, and you're good to go with ```var dominator = Dominator.getInstance();```

# functionality

#### ```dominator.initId```
Use this function to register a new DOM element, to be accessed later by dominator.dom[id]:
```javascript
dominator.initId('foo');
```

#### ```dominator.initIds```
Similar to ```dominator.initId```, but works on multiple ids passed either as an array or as an open-ended arguments list:
```javascript
dominator.initIds(['foo', 'bar']);//this works
dominator.initIds('oof', 'rab');//this works too!
```

#### ```dominator.onReady```
This function receives a callback which is fired once the document is actually loaded, and DOM initialization is done.
The callback is executed with all the DOM elements as the first and only argument. This function may also receive ids to be initialized, as shown:
```javascript
dominator.initId('foo');
dominator.onReady(function (dom) {
	//dom.foo
});
dominator.onReady('bar', function (dom) {
	//dom.bar
});
```

#### ```dominator.dom```
Ue this getter to access DOM elements directly, without the need for ```dominator.onReady``` (if for some legacy issues you have to use ```window.onload```:
```javascript
dominator.initId('foo');
window.onload = function(){
	//dominator.dom.foo
};
```

# tests
DOMinator is fully tested. Local tests can be easily run by:
```sh
$ grunt test
```

# build
Minified version can be found under [build folder](/build/dominator.min.js), and is generated by running:
```sh
$ grunt build
```
